This showcases a dynamic profile review system using JavaScript.
This mini-project, showcases a dynamic profile review system using JavaScript. It initializes with displaying a profile from a predefined list upon page load. The script allows users to navigate through profiles using "next" and "prev" buttons, cycling through an array of objects representing different profiles. Each profile contains a name, image, and a content description. Additionally, there's a "Read More/Less" toggle functionality to expand or contract the content for each review, enhancing user interaction and providing a more engaging experience.
